# QAP-2-Database-Design-Exercise
This repository contains the solutions for the second assignment of the Database Design course. The assignment focuses on designing a database schema based on provided business scenarios. It includes creating entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) and writing SQL code to create tables based on the identified entities. Each exercise is accompanied by a detailed description of the business scenario, a list of entities derived from the scenario, and a basic ER diagram illustrating the relationships between the entities. Additionally, the repository includes SQL scripts with CREATE statements for each designed entity, enabling the implementation of the database schema in PostgreSQL or any other relational database management system.
